# Advent of code 2023
repo to store my advent of code solutions

This is my first attempt at advent of code, i'm trying to figure out my own solutions but sometimes i'll end up using someone else's solution. I'm using them to learn better ways of coding and learning on how to tackle these problems.
If some days don't have solutions, that's because i couldn't make them, so far day 4 part 2 and day 5 part 2 won against me
